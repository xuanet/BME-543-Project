Authors: Kevin Xu, Jose Zarate, Nidhi Srivaths

## Description
Image processing algorithm to determine aortic pressure over time from 4D echocardiography data. User reorients ventricles, aortic valve, and encircles the 2D region bounding them in multiple slices. Algorithm calculates change in blood volume per frame and uses a mathematical model to calculate aortic pressure.
